Hi Vijay,

Apologies for the delay in getting back to you.

The next step in this selection process is to solve the sample questions attached with this mail.You need to solve any two of the assignments from the three attaced with this mail. 
No payment will be done for solving sample questions.There is no delivery deadline associated for delivery of the sample questions as is the case with real time assignments.

Merely solving the questions is not the the service we provide to our clients. Solutions provided by us are detailed with step by step explanations given. Our clients should actually be able to go through the solutions provided and learn from the same. Your solutions should be such that they address the above requirement.Kindly note that presentation of the solutions is very important for any assignments you will be doing for us, if you are selected.Hence do focus on this aspect in your solutions.

Once we receive the solutions from your side for the sample questions, we will get them reviewed by our subject matter expert. Based on the feedback received we shall either offer you th or not go ahead.

Let me know if you got any queries.

Thanks,
HR Team
